This is repo 2.0 of Project: Fjord

It is in every relevant sense a fork of the linux kernel, but not tied to the linux kernel network as of yet.

The stated goal of this project is tinification of the linux kernel, so as to be used in microcontroller applications or as a bootloader. Logistics of the project may change over time.

This is a project for Portland State University's capstone, so while the repo is open-source, we will not accept pull requests from outside the team until the completion date of the project.
